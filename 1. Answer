Web scraping is a common practice that can be used to extract data from websites. However, some websites use hCaptcha to prevent automated scraping. hCaptcha is a type of CAPTCHA that requires users to solve a challenge to prove they are human. It is designed to be more user-friendly than traditional CAPTCHAs, 
but it can still be a challenge for automated scraping.

There are several ways to bypass hCaptcha while scraping. One way is to use a CAPTCHA solving service like 2Captcha1. Another option is to use a browser extension like AnyCaptchaCallbackHooker2.
You can also try rotating IP addresses and User Agents3. However, these methods may not always work, and they may violate the websiteâ€™s terms of service.

As a project coordinator, you should consider the legal and ethical implications of web scraping. Some websites prohibit scraping in their terms of service, and scraping can also violate copyright laws.
If you decide to proceed with web scraping, you should ensure that you have the necessary permissions and that you are not violating any laws or regulations.
