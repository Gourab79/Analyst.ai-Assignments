LinkedIn provides APIs for developers to interact with LinkedIn Messaging.
You can use the LinkedIn Messaging API to send messages to other LinkedIn users. The API allows you to send messages to existing connections and invite new connections. 

There are also third-party APIs available that allow you to interact with LinkedIn Messaging. 
For example, the linkedin-messaging-api is an unofficial API that allows you to interact with LinkedIn Messaging using Python. 

Please note that LinkedIn has strict policies regarding the use of its APIs, and you must comply with these policies when using the APIs. 
You should also ensure that you have the necessary permissions before sending messages to other LinkedIn users.
