To find LinkedIn company pages from a list of company names, you can use tools like Derrick1 or PhantomBuster2. These tools allow you to input a list of company names and extract the corresponding LinkedIn URLs.

Please note that some companies may not have a LinkedIn page, and some pages may be private or restricted. 
Also, web scraping is a complex process that requires technical expertise and may violate LinkedInâ€™s terms of service.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that you are not violating any laws or regulations before proceeding with web scraping.
