To estimate the income range of LinkedIn profiles, you can use LinkedIn Talent Insights1. This tool provides compensation information when viewing talent pool reports. 
The data is inferred using LinkedIn Salary data collected from LinkedIn members and estimated based on similar roles, companies, and regions. 
You can use the salary insights to compare compensation within the overall market and among peers1.
Another way to estimate income range is to use LinkedIn demographics. 
According to a survey conducted by Pew Research Center in 2019, 98% of those who earn an annual income of $75K and over are LinkedIn subscribers2.
Additionally,50% of LinkedIn users earn $75,000 per year, and another 21% of users have an income between $30,000 and $74,999 per year3.
These statistics can help you estimate the income range of your clientâ€™s LinkedIn profiles.
